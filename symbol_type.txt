SYMBOL TYPE
###########

A “symbol” represents a unique identifier. Symbols are guaranteed to be unique. Even if we create many symbols with the same description, they are different values. The description is just a label that doesn’t affect anything.

let id = Symbol();
let idWithLabel = Symbol('label');

let id1 = Symbol("id");
let id2 = Symbol("id");

console.log(id1 == id2); 	//-> false

id1;			//-> 	Symbol(id)
id1.toString	//->	"Symbol(id)"

USE CASES
Object keys can be strings or Symbols. 

When “Hidden” object properties are needed that cannot be overwritten or used by accident, use a Symbol. They will not show up in a for...in loop.
