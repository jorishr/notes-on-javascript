Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,

part two: %3 not 5, %5 not 3, %5 and %3

If %5 add "buzz" to string
The concatenation will result that numbers with %3 and %5 get
the "fizzbuzz".

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using 
newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there 
is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a 
chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

/*
LOGIC  
- build a string where you add either a blank space or a #
- when put a blank space or #?
- use odd or even for constructing a line

- to create new lines you have to add "\n"
- to repeat this process: put the line constructor loop inside another loop
that adds the \n to the string after each line is constructed.

- problem: by just using x%2 you get lines that with the same pattern
the solutions: add the line counter to the conditional:
line 0 position 2: even, thus add " "
line 0 position 3: odd, thus add # 
line 1 position 2: odd, thus add #
line 1 position 3: even, thus add " "

- to make sure it works for any size, add binding and change 8 in the 
for loops

There are two scenario's: 
- more kids than toys n > t. The last kid to receive a toy is i + t -1

5 kids, 4 toys, start at 1 -> 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-0   //-> 4 (1 + 4 -1)
5 kids, 2 toys, start at 1 -> 1-1 2-2 3-0 4-0 5-0   //-> 2 (1 + 2 -1)
5 kids, 2 toys, start at 2 -> 1-0 2-1 3-2 4-0 5-0   //-> 3 (2 + 2 -1)

- more toys than kids n < t. The last kid that gets a toy is the remainder or 
modulo of i + (t % n) -1
NOTE: only works when i = 1 or i = 2

5 kids, 9 toys, start at 1
-> 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 
-> 1-6 2-7 3-8 4-9 5-0  //-> 4 (1 + (9%5) -1)
