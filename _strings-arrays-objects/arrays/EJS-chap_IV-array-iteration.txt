#############################
ARRAY ITERATION WITH FOR EACH
#############################

The .forEach() method is built-in since 2009 and is faster than using the for loop. It is part of the array proto-type, the collection of methods that can be applied to all arrays (such as shift, unshift, pop, push,..)

SYNTAX
arr.forEach(fn(){...});

Thus for each item in the array, a function will be performed.

var colors = ["#fff", "green", "yellow", "red"];

colors.forEach(function(){
  document.write("hello"); 
})

colors.forEach(function(clr){
  document.write("<br />" + colors + "&nbsp;" + clr);
})

Thus for each item in the array, a function will be peformed, namely: print the content of the array and a line break, plus the each item of the array, at the respective iteration

This is the result:

#fff,green,yellow,red #fff 
#fff,green,yellow,red green
#fff,green,yellow,red yellow
#fff,green,yellow,red red 

Thus, the argument clr in our function comes to hold the value of each item in the array, as the forEach loops through the array.


DIFFERENCE WITH A FOR LOOP

In a FOR LOOP you work with a number (i) that goes from index 0 to the end of the array; 

In the forEach method you use an ABSTRACTION, a temporary name as placeholder, inside a function.
