MY JS TOOLBOX OVERVIEW AND TOOL COMPARISON

CONDITIONALS
if/else statements
switch/case 

logical operators || or ? to choose between two options 

LOOPS 
while, do, for

WHILE versus FOR: when no clear beginning and/or end point is set, you use while loop. If you know the beginning and end point of the loop, you better use for.

DO: execute the code block once, then check for condition.

FOR loop without know end point: for(init; ;step){code; break;}




CHECK PERFORMANCE OF CODE


const startAt = performance.now()

// code to check

const endAt = performance.now()

console.log(`${endAt - startAt} ms to execute`)
